    The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in our
    solar system. It plays a vital role in our lives, influencing ocean tides
    and lighting up the night sky. With its cratered surface and mysterious dark
    plains called "maria," the Moon has fascinated humans for thousands of
    years. It continues to be a symbol of exploration and wonder as we look
    toward future missions beyond Earth.
