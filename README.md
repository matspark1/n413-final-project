| Salmane | Primary - #EBE4DE, Accent - #BA822E, Background - #6F332F, Text - #FFFFFF| The main theme has a lighter background with darker colors on everything else I did the opposite but i didn't make the style too dark| This gives us an option that's darker but still a little if we want to swhitch styles|
