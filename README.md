## Project Summary

This space-themed web project covers topics like the Moon, Mars, and the International Space Station. Built with a custom WordPress block theme, the site supports different style options and focuses on both learning and ease of use. It includes blog pages, a contact form, and a newsletter signup to keep users connected.

## Key Takeaways

Through this project, we built a custom WordPress block theme by setting up templates, styling, and structure. We used theme.json to manage global styles and create style variants. Organizing content improved our understanding of HTML and accessible design. Adding a contact form and newsletter signup helped us practice interactive elements.

## Design Choices

| Variant | Element / Block | Change          | Rationale          |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Default    | Primary - #1a1a1a, Accent - #7e36d7, Background - #333333, Text -#dbdbdb           | Description     | Why                |
| Salmane    | Primary - #EBE4DE, Accent - #BA822E, Background - #6F332F, Text - #FFFFFF           |  The main theme has a lighter background with darker colors on everything else I did the opposite but i didn't make the style too dark     | This gives us an option that's darker but still a little if we want to swhitch styles                |
| Matthew    | Primary - #38db92, Accent - #3ed4d4, Background - #212423, Text - #e3e3e3           | This theme has a brighter look with more unqiue colors and a kind of nebula theme.     | It makes the website more appealing visually with a more spacey vibe.                |
| Jonathon    | Color           | Description     | Why                |
